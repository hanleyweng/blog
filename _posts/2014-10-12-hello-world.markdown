Hi, I'm Hanley. This journal serves to document my works, experiments, and offshoot thoughts - both new and old.

Over time, I'll fill up this blog with my past projects along with new ones.

This site is generated using jekyll and served via github pages, so the [progress and code is visible here](https://github.com/hanleyweng/blog/commits/gh-pages).
