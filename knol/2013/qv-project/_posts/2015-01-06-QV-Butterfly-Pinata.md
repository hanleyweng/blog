The 'Butterfly Pinata' was an interactive installation set up at QV Melbourne where visitors could play a game by waving their hands around and posting the picture online.

The project was set up for [QV Melbourne's](http://www.qv.com.au) Spring Festival, in a spatious area upon which a glasshouse was assembled.

## Role and Process

As a Technical Lead part of [Bienalto Sydney](http://www.bienalto.com/), I worked remotely with [Wunderman](http://www.wunderman.com/) Melbourne's [Adam Horne](http://www.adamhorne.com/) (Creative Director) - advising on timelines, hardware, and different solutions. 
I developed a few protoypes with varying robustness to different environments that could be tested remotely. These included Kinect vision-based, mobile-phone motion-based, and web-cam vision-based installations.

*This five second video provides a snippet of the computer vision, visitors, and animation involved in the final installation.*
