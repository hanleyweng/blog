Over the weekend, I stumbled across the [Comic Vine API].

Growing up, Spidey was always my favourite comic book hero, so as an excercise in data mining - I decided to go through all the Spider-Man volumes and issues and mine the comic book covers, compiling them into a collage.

Here's a poster collage image:
