From mid-2012 to early 2013 I was part of the 'Open Energy Display Project' supervised by Dr Martin Tomitsch and in collaboration with Mobitec Australia Pty Ltd.

The project is an expanded technological augmentation of a prior project that displayed competitive electricity consumption on blackboards above residents houses [[article link]](http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/social-competition-can-cut-electricity-use-says-university-of-sydney-study-20140709-zsxfh.html).

Various system setups were explored and evaluated. These included hardware components such as Flip-Dot displays, [emonTx](http://openenergymonitor.org/emon/emontx), and hardware for the control and communication of displays.

Additional information is under a Non-Disclosure Agreement.

Overall an interesting and informative electronic project.
