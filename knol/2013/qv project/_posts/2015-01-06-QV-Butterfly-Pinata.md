Whilst working out of Bienalto Sydney, we were contacted by Wunderman Melbourne to create an interactive installation in preparation for the Spring Festival. Passerbys would hit a pinata until it burst, the interactions were posted on social media and players went into a draw to win a prize.

As technical lead, various implementations were explored. Developing an interactive installation remotely was a challenge, as such installations are tied to their environment. A few prototype implementations were developed with varying robustness to different environments. These included a Kinect-based installation, mobile-peripheral based (which would utilise either the user's phones, or provided peripherals), and a web-cam based version.

The final environment dictated the development of the web-cam based implementation.

Here's a short video showing off:

- the basic computer vision processes of the installation in debug mode
- followed by people playing with the installation
- and the pianata explosion of butterflies
