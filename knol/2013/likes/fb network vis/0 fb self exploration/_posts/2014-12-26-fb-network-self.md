#### The Likes Project

_Developing personal tastes is a skill which I've found difficult. As such, a personal desire arose from this to visualise historic likes, favourites, and starred items in an effort to identify evolving personal interests._

## Network of Facebook Shares

The titles of articles shared on Facebook was gathered together. Keywords were then transformed into a network, with links between keywords that appeared together.

Colours are 'communities' of keywords, whereas the larger the word, the more it was mentioned.

Up to this point in time, I seem to be posting quite a bit about Google, Animation, Apple Products, and Design. Also some smaller interests in Marvel, Games, Zombie and Pixar Movies, Augmented Reality and Infographics.
