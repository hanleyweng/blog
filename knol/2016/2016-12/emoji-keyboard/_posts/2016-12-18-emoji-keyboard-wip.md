Been finding most emoji keyboards quite cumbersome lately. So I've started interviewing people about their use of emojis. 

Put together an early prototype for an emoji keyboard, that allows categories to be combined and has a 'prediction / recent emojis' bar. [Playable here.](emoji-keyboard-test/index.html)

Work in progress. Shall prototype and test more. And report on the findings soon.
