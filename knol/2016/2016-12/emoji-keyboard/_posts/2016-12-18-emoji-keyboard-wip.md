Been finding emoji keyboards cumbersome lately. So I've started interviewing people about how they input emojis. 

[![snapshot](_cover_image/original.jpg)](files/keyboard-prototypes/10-key/index.html)

Put together 3 new emoji keyboard prototypes. Also created a speed test for these prototypes, as well as standard and 3rd party emoji keyboards. 

1. ["10-Key"](files/keyboard-prototypes/10-key/index.html). A keyboard, similar to most emoji keyboards, with a suggestion bar, and limited categories. 
2. ["24-Key"](files/keyboard-prototypes/24-key/index.html). A keyboard where the user selects multiple categories.
3. ["Keywords"](files/keyboard-prototypes/qwerty/index.html). Emojis are found by the standard qwerty keyboard.

- ["Generic Speed Test"](files/emoji-speed-test/index.html). A speed test for all emoji keyboards (default or 3rd party).

The purpose of the tests aren't to gage speed. Moreso the learning curve, and intuitiveness of these prototypes. 

A few tests have been conducted. So far, people have been drawn towards the ['Keywords'](files/keyboard-prototypes/qwerty/index.html) prototype most. Shall report on findings after some more user tests.

\* _Note: These demoes are geared towards Apple users' mental models of emojis. The categories and ordering of emojis are different on Android and iOS - this is due to different design-priorities as the mobile UI of their OS' evolved. Android is starting to follow closely; [Suggested Emoji Categories](http://www.unicode.org/emoji/charts/emoji-ordering.html) via [unicode emoji r51](http://unicode.org/reports/tr51/). However many Android users are on variations of the initial Android layout (with 5-cateories), largely due to 3rd party keyboards and the nature of Android versions. Apple (on Mac, and as of iOS8) tends to follow the [emoji-one](http://emojione.com/) model. **Basically:** Apple, Android, and early-adopter Android users think differently, which means different designs are needed._

\* _Note 2: Though the visuals are textured. These are still simple prototypes intended for user testing. There are technical, UI, and visual bugs that aren't addressed at this fidelity._
