Been finding most emoji keyboards quite cumbersome lately. So I've started interviewing people about their use of emojis. 

Put together an early prototype for an emoji keyboard, that allows categories to be combined and has a 'prediction / recent emojis' bar. You can [Play it here, and see how fast you can find emojis.](emoji-keyboard-test/emoji-10key/index.html) *

Work in progress. Shall prototype and test more. And report on the findings soon.

\* _Note: This demo is geared towards Apple users' mental models of emojis. The categories and ordering of emojis are different on Android and iOS - this is due to different design-priorities as the mobile UI of their OS' evolved. Android is starting to follow closely; [Suggested Emoji Categories](http://www.unicode.org/emoji/charts/emoji-ordering.html) via [unicode emoji r51](http://unicode.org/reports/tr51/). However many Android users are on variations of the initial Android layout (with 5-cateories), largely due to 3rd party keyboards and the nature of Android versions. Apple (on Mac, and as of iOS8) tends to follow the [emoji-one](http://emojione.com/) model. **Basically:** Apple, Android, and early-adopter Android users think differently, which means different designs are needed._

_Update 2016-12-20: Updated Demo to include Speedtest._
