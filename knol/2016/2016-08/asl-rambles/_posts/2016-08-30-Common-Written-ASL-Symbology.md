In thinking more about a SignWritten-ASL Keyboard, I've been taking inspiration from Chinese and Japanese Keyboard input systems on iOS, especially the 9-button keyboards.

_(Update 2016-08-31: I mistakingly thought that these iOS keyboards change their layout dynamically, they in fact do not, something I've taken into account in my next post.)_

If we're going to develop a keyboard with only 9-keys, the keyboard will have to be dynamic, changing with each press - in order to cover a pictorial language like SignWriting. With this in mind, it's important to look into the 'thinking-order' of written ASL.

With the primary aid of [ASLFont's article on Ways to Write](https://aslfont.github.io/Symbol-Font-For-ASL/ways-to-write.html) the following analysis was made of the following written ASL forms: [Stokoe Notation, International Sign Writing Alphabet, HamNoSys, SignFont, ASLphabet, ASL Orthography, si5s, ASLSJ, and SignScript].

## Common ASL Symbol Categories Order

The most common descriptive categories of symbols in written ASL are:

1. Handshape / Location / Movement.
2. Orientation.
3. Other: e.g. Quality / Repetition / Descriptions of Non-Dominant Hand / Contact-Region.

Most of the elegible forms (7 of 8), ordered the most common motions as such:

**1. Handshape, Location, Movement.**

Only Stoke Notation put location first. Four of the forms adhering to this common order used Orientation, with the most prominent (3 of 4) ordering:

1. Handshape, 2. ~Orientation, 3. Location, 4. Movement

## Common ASL Search Categories

LifePrint and SignSavy are English-to-ASL dictionaries and irrelevant here.

[Handspeak's](http://www.handspeak.com/word/asl-eng/) search categories include:

- Handshapes (36)
- Movement (4)
- Location (13)
- N-Handed/Timing (3)

[Signwritten:ASL Sign Puddle](http://www.signbank.org/signpuddle2.0/index.php?ui=1&sgn=4) allows search by Symbol (filtered by Symbol Group, Frequency, or specific Symbol). This means it can not search by 'N-Handed/Timing', or 'Relative-Location'.

## Handshape Hierarchies

Most written ASL evidences prioritising Handshape as the first, and therefore, critical symbol category. However, the number of ASL handshapes used are many {20,50,80 ~distribution}. Some help provide order to these symbols with hierarchy:

| ASL Form.                       | Top Category Count. | ~ SubCategory Distribution. | Total | 
|---------------------------------|---------------------|-----------------------------|-------| 
| SignBank ASL Picture Dictionary | 5                   | -                           | -     | 
| ASLFont : Quote                 | 7                   | -                           | -     | 
| ASLFont : Handshapes            | 5                   | 6,10,10,12,13               | 51    | 
| HamNoSys                        | 6                   | 3 >> 4                      | 32    | 
| HandSpeak                       | 12                  | [1,4,6]                     | 36    | 
| SignPuddle                      | 10                  | [10,20,60] >> â€¦             | 100+  | 
| SLIP                            | 26                  | -                           | 55    | 
| Stokoe Notation                 | -                   | -                           | 19    | 
| SignFont                        | -                   | -                           | 21    | 
|                                 |                     |                             |       |

Though most Handshapes range far beyond a reachable limit for a dynamic keyboard with only 9 keys, it is foreseeable that a mental model exists to support the multiplication of 5-10 basic handshapes with 4-10 modifiers to cover the ASL handshapes. HamNoSys is an excellent source of inspiration in its elegance.

## Summary

Mental Ordering for common written ASL symbols can be estimated as:

**1. Handshape, 2. (Optional) Orientation, 3. Location, 4. Movement**

Accessing all Handshapes with a small dynamic 9-button keypad appears viable!
