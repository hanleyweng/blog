As part of the [Computer Human Adapter Interaction Lab]() (CHAI) in 2011 I was asked to generate a few concepts and assets for horizontal and vertical interactive surfaces.

## Concepts
UI Concepts for the vertical interface 'file-explorer' system included a 2D radial interface akin to [Daisy Disk](https://daisydiskapp.com/), as well as a 3D interface akin to the 3D interfaces seen in John Underkoffler's Ted Talk [Pointing to the future of UI](https://www.ted.com/talks/john_underkoffler_drive_3d_data_with_a_gesture?language=en) of Minority Report / [Oblong Industries](http://www.oblong.com/) fame.

These 2 file-explorer concepts, in addition to a more traditional folder-file concept, were prototyped with the aid of Java, Processing, and Python - to data-mine, procedurally generate, and render the interactive interfaces.

## Assets
The Cruiser Operating System was also overdue for an update in graphics.

Some of the updated assets:

In addition to some High-Resolution Backgrounds:

Also created an A4 Printout for the functions of the Cruiser Touchtable Interface:

Overall, a nice opportunity to conceptualise and prototype interfaces, as well as create visual assets.
