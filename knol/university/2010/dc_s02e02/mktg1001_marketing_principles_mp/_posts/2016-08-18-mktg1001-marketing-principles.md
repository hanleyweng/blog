MKTG1001 Marketing Principles was undertaken in 2011. Overall some business-oriented information was retained, however, the structure (large class sizes, and undirected tutorials) in addition to subpar resources did detriment the course.

Textbook used: "Principles of Marketing" - Kotler, Adam, Denize, Armstrong

Assignments involved 1. presenting some basic [statistics](_posts_assets/A1 - Statistics.pdf) and 2. presenting on Marketing Segmentation [[writeup]](_posts_assets/A2 - MKTGTask2Writeup-1.pdf) [[slides]](_posts_assets/A2 - MP - T2.pdf)

_August 2016: In reflection, this course really did have a drastically different culture due to it its large size and standardised processes. Very different to other courses in Design, Arts, Cognitive & Computer Sciences._
