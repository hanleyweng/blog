As part of the DECO2200 Interaction Design Course taught by Martin Tomitsch and tutored by Nikash Singh, Nadine Denten and I worked on a new Social Network Interface for our final project titled 'Bounce'.

After some initial user research, our concept became formulating itself as a series of playful physical circles upon which social actions could be enacted.
