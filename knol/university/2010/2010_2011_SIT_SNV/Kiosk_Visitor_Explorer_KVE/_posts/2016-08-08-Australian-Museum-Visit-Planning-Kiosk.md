The [Computer Human Adapter Interaction Lab (CHAI)](http://chai.it.usyd.edu.au/index.cgi), as part of [Smart Services CRC](http://www.smartservicescrc.com.au/), was contacted by the [Australian Museum](http://australianmuseum.net.au/) to design multi-user touch table experiences.

The design for a Visit Planning Kiosk was developed following a series of ethnographic studies to the Australian Museum.

During this time, [a preliminary two-minute features proposal video for the Kiosk was also produced (No Audio)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7ZIv3hiHYc&feature=youtu.be).

The multitouch table application was coded in the Cruiser Multitouch Operating System in C++, with assets created in the Adobe Suite and procedurally.

## Thanks

Many thanks to Anthony Collins of Cruiser Interactive who was a great mentor. Also to friends and colleagues whom were working on their own applications and algorithms but were always keen on insightful and miscellaneous chats: Peter Ward, Cameron Silvestrini, Adam Gawronski and George Zhang.
