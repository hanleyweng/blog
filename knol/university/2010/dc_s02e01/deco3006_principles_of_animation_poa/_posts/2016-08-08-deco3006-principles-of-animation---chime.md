Under the tutelage of Neil McCann, we had the opportunity to learn and practice the Principles of Animation. 

## Lab Excercises

Tutorials were really fun and helpful in aiding an understanding of the Principles of Animations. [Some of the tutorial outcomes are archived.](_posts_assets/1 Lab_Work archive)

## \*Chime\* (Final Project Animation)

In undertaking the final animation:

a storyboard was [created](_posts_assets/1b [Storyboard] Chimes - Hanley Weng - 309248434.swf) and [revised](_posts_assets/storyboard5.swf), revised version:

With the aid of Adobe Flash and After Effects, as well as a lovely collaboration with music composer Sylvia Lim, the final animation was created:

## Overall

It was incredibly fun to be doing animation. A really great class. Sylvia was also an excellent sound composer and it was great to collaborate.
