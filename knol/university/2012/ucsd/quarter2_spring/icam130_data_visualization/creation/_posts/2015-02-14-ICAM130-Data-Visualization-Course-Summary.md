Data Visualisation at UCSD, taught by Lev Manovich, was one of the funner courses I've experienced.

The data visualised were unique in that it centred around visual assets; images, rather than numbers or words. This was great for melding skills in data processing and analysis, and a desire to improve in visual design - faciliated by an atmosphere of talented mentors and colleagues.

Such visual explorations included:

And for the main project of ICAM130 (and bit of an independent study):

The Deviant Art studies were presented at 'Best of ICAM'.

Overall the course was very well taught, with supportive and skilled mentors and colleagues. I learnt a lot in regards to the union between data manipulation, information synthesis, and aesthetic visualization - the art of data visualization.
