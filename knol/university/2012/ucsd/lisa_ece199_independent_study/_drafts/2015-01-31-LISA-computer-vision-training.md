During my time at UCSD, I helped out the [Laboratory for Intelligent and Safe Automobiles (LISA)](http://cvrr.ucsd.edu/LISA/), part of the ['Computer Vision and Robotics Research Laboratory' (CVRR)](http://cvrr.ucsd.edu). Whilst there, I trained and tagged videos from drives and proposed alterations to the computer programs; notably the graphical user interface to streamline workflows. Additional input devices were proposed to streamline the workflow, such as the use of an ipad for multi-finger gestures in simultaneous conjunction with mouse and keyboard for precise input.
