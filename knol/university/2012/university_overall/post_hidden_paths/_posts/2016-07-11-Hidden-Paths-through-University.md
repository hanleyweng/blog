During University (at the University of Sydney, and the University of California, San Diego) , I discovered there were many hidden paths through the University system; core subjects can be taken out of turn, and they can even be substituted for other similar-enough subjects, within or outside of the University. The default path outlined by the University is largely that, you really are free to craft your own education.

_The need to craft one's own course was especially important in my degree; Design Computing, where 50% of the subjects were electives - and where courses and their associated teachers could change each semester._

Over the years, I've realised a good teacher is everything; the course content doesn't matter nearly as much as who's teaching it. 

To get a good feel of different teachers, and interests in courses; I sat in ('audited') a lot of classes - which has led to many friendships and colleagues that wouldn't have been formed otherwise. (Even after deciding on the official subjects for the semester, sit-ins would continue to be great source of knowledge and social interactions.)

My University plan covered the extent of my tertiary education - but changed every semester; there would be vague sets of subjects I knew I would be interested in later on - which would require more distinctive pre-requisites early on.

At the start of each semester (or prior) I would note down every possible subject I may want to attend (either officially or unofficially), prioritising pre-requisites that opened the door to more interesting categories of courses down the road. I then tried to attend parts of each course during the first week (or the previous semester to suss out the teacher and content) - as to get a better feeling of which courses should be taken officially, and which would simply be sit-ins.

The photo below is an example of one of these pre-semester plan (UCSD Spring Quarter).

An important realisation was that many core courses can often be substituted with another course of similar material - and such courses can sometimes be found in completely different departments (e.g. one core 'Information Visualisation' was taught, and could be substituted, across: Archaeology, Computer Science, Design, and Architecture). In undergrad - you can even sometimes elect to substitute in a post-graduate course! So you are not restricted to your faculty, nor your graduate-status, nor even your University (e.g. Exchange Universities and Colleges can sometimes offer better teachings on a subject - and more fun).

P.S. If you're in a degree where your marks don't matter (mine was Computer Science & Design) - I've observed it's *always* best to take the advanced class - even if you're the bottom of the class; you're surrounded by people much smarter than you whom are often more than willing to help (perhaps because they're not spending time struggling as much with the content themselves). 

Overall; University is a great chance to learn and make new social groups - a little foresight and sit-ins are great for this. Many of the perceived structures and 'rules' in University Systems are more like guidelines and can certainly be challenged. Most of all - have fun!
