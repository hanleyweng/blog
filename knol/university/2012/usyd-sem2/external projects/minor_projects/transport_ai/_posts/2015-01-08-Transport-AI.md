This was an early attempt at creating a Contextual Google Now like app for personal transit. Though it was scrapped shortly after Google Now was announced, it was useful learning regarding web technologies (and the plethora of services involved in building a web app as opposed to a native one). 

The final app had all the basic functionality (including auto-update and auto-filling) required except for *Visual Styling* and the contextual awareness. So the full concept seems like it would be quite viable within a short timeframe. 

Here's a screenshot of the last state of the app:
