DECO3200 Human Computer Experience Design Studio, was a nice hardware-oriented course taught by Dr Oliver Bown at the University of Sydney in the Design Computing degree.

It was quite fun to explore and make networks, soundscapes, and robots.

Primary Projects:

- [Multiscreen Soundscape (excercise)](projects_/multiscreen_acoustic_ecology/Multiscreen-Soundscape.html)
- [Lit Ecology (shelved side project)](projects_/lit_ecology/Lit-Ecology.html)
- [Secret Lives of Computer Systems (main project)](Secret-Lives.html)
