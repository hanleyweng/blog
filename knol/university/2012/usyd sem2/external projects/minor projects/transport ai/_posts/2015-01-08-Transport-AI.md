This was an early attempt at creating a Contextual Google Now like app for personal transit. Though it was scrapped shortly after Google Now was announced, it taught me quite a bit about web technologies (and the plethora of services involved in building a web app as opposed to a native one). 

The final app had all the basic functionality (including auto-updated and auto-filling) required except for styling and the contextual awareness.

Here's a screenshot of the last state of the app:
