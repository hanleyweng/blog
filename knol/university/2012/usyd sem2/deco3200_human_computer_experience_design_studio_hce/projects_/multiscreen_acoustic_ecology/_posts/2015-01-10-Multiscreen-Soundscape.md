'Multiscreen Soundscape' is a short excercise in OSC technologies, part of DECO3200. It envisions a flock of birds that travel amongst computers, tracked by a viewer's hearing and vision.

## Process

First, brainstorming was undertaken for an interactive accoustic ecology.

Secondly, a setup system was formalised for quickly identifying the position and orientations of different computers.

Simple character traversal (represented by a mouse) was implemented between the two screens.

Finally the flocks of birds was implemented [(video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZqT8l17cic) as seen in the first video. 

It was quite nice to have the work on the university studio computers - especially for the auditory sensors, as flocks of 'birds' moved from one area of the studio to another. 

## Reflection

Again, should have documented/videoed installation when it was on the Studio computers.
