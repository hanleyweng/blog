![Lit Ecology concept image](images/concept.png)

__Lit Ecology__ was a concept formed during the course _DECO3200 Human Computer Experience Design Studio_. It was a side-project from my main project in the course (Secret Lives) with Emila Yang. 

Due to the load from our main projects, competitions, and conferences - the concept is currently shelved.

## Concept

An ecology of flocking fireflies, represented in an eternally reflected room of hanging vines of leds, move and flutter around their environment, jumping from light to light. As humans enter and traverse their domain, they interact with them through responsive movement and sound.

## Process

Following a [brief play with Arduino and LEDs (video link)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yts7caCJgqY&feature=youtu.be).

The relevant hardware components were investigated and determined.

[A simulation program was created to visualise potential animations (PDE ZIP).](0 working files/LitEcologyVisualisation.zip)

All the while, we continuously searched for technical and aesthetic references.
