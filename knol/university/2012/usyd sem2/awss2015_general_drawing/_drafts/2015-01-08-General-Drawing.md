This was a rather fun course taught by Sue Pedley where we got to practice drawing in a variety of styles. It was supplemented with research into the techniques and styles of different artists [[PDF1](1 homework research/ArtistTechniqueResearchv2.pdf), [DOC2](1 homework research/Edgar Degas.docx)].
