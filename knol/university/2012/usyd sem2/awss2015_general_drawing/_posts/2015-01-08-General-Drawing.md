General Drawing (AWSS2015) was a rather fun course taught by Sue Pedley where we had the opportunity to practice drawing in a variety of styles. 

The course was supplemented with some light research into the techniques and styles of different artists [(Joy Hester, Mike Parr, William Kentridge, David Hockney, Giacometti)](1_select_media/theory/ArtistTechniqueResearchv2 (Joy Hester, Mike Parr, William Kentridge, David Hockney, Giacometti).pdf) and [Edgar Degas](1_select_media/theory/Edgar Degas.docx).

A sketchbook was maintained showing different experiments, as we progressed from sketches, studying other artists, different artistic techniques, shadows, colour, perspective, and different canvas materials.

Here's a collage of the sketcbook in chronological order:

Shadows, different drawing techniques, and materials were truly wonderful to play with.

Throughout the course, we also composed on larger mediums. Here are a few personal favourites:
