COMP5048 Information Visualisation was a course taught by Seok-Hee Hong, associated with the InfoVis group at the School of Information Technologies. Being a Computer Science, it was a very interesting algorithmic-focused complement to my understanding of Information Visualisation from the Design and Archaeology realms.

A [student journal](https://decohan.wordpress.com/category/comp5048/) was retained throughout the course.

One of our early excercises involved the [drawing of a small social network originally described as text](https://decohan.wordpress.com/2011/08/21/basic-force-graph/). I elected to use Processing; beginning with automated force-directed methods, adding repulsion (Hooke's law) and springs, coupled with manual tweaks to visuals.

In the final project, I teamed up with Adam Gawronski to work on a visualisation of University of Sydney Courses. Producing an interactive visualisation below:

During the course, we were also encouraged to participate in the [18th Graph Drawing Contest](http://graphdrawing.de/contest2011/topic1-2011.html), part of the [International Symposium on Graph Drawing (GD)](http://www.graphdrawing.org).

A student report was written up of the proposed graph-solutions to the competition problems and their process.

Graph A of [the GD11 submission](_posts_assets/COMP5048_A1_GD_Contest.pdf) here won the 'Straight-Line Planar' segment of the Competition.

Overall a very insightful class, learnt much from the algorithmic computer-science perspective of Information Visualisation.
