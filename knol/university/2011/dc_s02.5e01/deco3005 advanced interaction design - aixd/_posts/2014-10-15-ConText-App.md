This app was the final assignment for DECO3005 (AIXD, Advanced Interaction Design). The concept went through a few iterations before finally landing on the final one.

## Process

### Ground Ideation

After conducting some initial user research and participatory design into people's core desires, framed in a technologically futuristic and personal-data driven context - I arrived at a couple concepts.

See the summary for an elaboration on people's core motivators and resulting ideas. [[PDF]](content/final assignment/0a pd motivators session/AIXD-GroundingIdeationPost1.pdf)

### Reminders App

These concepts formulated from the ideation phase eventually formulated into a 'Reminders' App.

## Future work

Abstractly speaking, the breath of the ideal progressed like so:

ideally, future iterations would narrow in scope much earlier:

[AttrakDiff] also proved to be a very nice tool for evaluating hedonic and pragmatic qualities, quantifying how user experiences could be improved in future.
