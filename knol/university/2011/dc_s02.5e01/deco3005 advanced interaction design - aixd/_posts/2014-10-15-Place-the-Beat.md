Web-app mockup that maps heart rate with user-location and time. 
This was a student exercise in building app prototypes with phonegap and other web technologies.

It was really nice to be able to build something for mobile and touch interactions. [D3] also served to be a great web library for visualisation.

There's still something a bit off though with using something like phonegap to build a native-looking app. I'm of the mindset that currently mobile apps should either be:

- built completely native, and look like a native app
- or built purely with web technologies, and embrace the notion that it isn't native
