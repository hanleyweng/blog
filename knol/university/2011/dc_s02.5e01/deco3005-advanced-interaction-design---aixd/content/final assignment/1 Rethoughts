Rethinking Idea
?

Proposed Alterations.
Focusing more on Habbits - Recurrence.
Reward and Punishment

Implementation
Bit more of a focus on the pervasiveness - pico-projected ocr.

~ encouragement to keep entering
	/ automatically get that data
	/ might already have calendar
	
integration from twitter or facebook.
like the i feel fine project.

yes / no this is a goal

aid for auto-aggregation.

twitter calendar blackboard.

aggregate from existing
address the input automatically, and just address management. don't have to deal with input anymore.

can describe / demonstrate the nfc integration, task done prompt confirm

- transition between different display spaces, the flicking, different visual aesthetics using existing metaphors.
- e.g. if on wall, it's a wall calendar, if desk it's like a notebook

- don't think about input, just think about output


personal information experience, not management.
focus on the expirience.

all this data is in one central pot and visualizing 

one device (with projector) over multiple surfaces.

try to understand what is the difference between projecting on different surfaces.
[ e.g. what's the purpose of projecting from phone to arm/palm ]

moving to guestural form.

move on from goals 


think about visualization on different projection surfaces.

maybe that's your only input, the distance, and the projection surface.

see what their overall day would look like, not only tasks, things everything ... 

projection - public and private

project something close - more personal info perhaps.

pick one possibility.

perhaps don't get rid of personal informatics screen, but work out the context and situation to show that.

~ projecting on fridge? living room?

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
[ some more talk with Martin ]

do have some technical implementation - the pico projector etc.

would like to see code that utilizes the data and then turns it into some visualization (don't do illustrator mockups)

look at the aspect of TRANSFERING! - flicking. initially the screen is on the phone still (so code for that). but it can be transfered!

could use combination of objective-c and processing

can transfer to tv - can put it into context of tv (like a movie!)
+ other ones, like different surfaces and multitouch tables tablets.

have the zooming effect. - fake around.

interface on iphone can be done in objective c
	- phone could be portal where you manage everything that is aggregated
	- think about what are the interactions that are happening on the phone.
	- some visualizations might be wanted to be seen on the phone rather than anywhere else.

develop for other surfaces too!
	put a sheet on the wall and sketch it!
	e.g. if we really want to make a calendar on the wall, then can do in different languages, different video
	
though different languages.
	- should all look the same (undistinguishable that it was done in different languages).
	
if don't have enough time, it's ok to do the wall mockup, doesn't have to be coded.

spend more time on the video than the creation of app.

social memories platform
	- using the metaphor of data - book metaphor

- don't loose the reflection aspect! the concept is still good.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

don't focus on data entry, focus on data representation

still want a design on the iphone with transfering aspects (iOS)

possible judge of distance; augmented reality,
