## Abstract

The rise of the smart-phone has lead to an increase in the popularity of casual games, often with social aspects, and has enabled the idea of geolocated social networks. As more mobile games introduce social components, geolocated social networks are augmenting themselves with indirect game mechanics. In this paper we explore the intersection of these two areas through the design of a geolocated casual game that facilitates both the creation and play of geolocated levels. Throughout development, we describe key findings that result from iterative cycles of user feedback.
