COMP3608, Advanced Introduction to Artificial Intelligence - has turned out to be an enjoyable and extremely useful course (especially in reflection). Taught by Irena Koprinska, the content really opens up possibilities in projects not traditionally thought of under standard statistics and algorithms.

For part of the course, [Weka] was used; "a collection of machine learning algorithms for data mining tasks". It's a pretty nice program that offers a user interface which allows quick access and experimentation with a range of different algorithms.

Two books were used:

- [Data Mining - Practical Machine Learning Tools and Techniques]
- [Artificial Intelligence - A Modern Approach by Russell and Norvig]
