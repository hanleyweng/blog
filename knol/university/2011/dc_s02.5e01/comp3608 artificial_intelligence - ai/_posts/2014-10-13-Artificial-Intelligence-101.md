I had a really fun time taking this subject. It really opens up the possibilities in projects and has proved extremely beneficial in  works which were undertaken years after.

Was introduced to [Weka] "a collection of machine learning algorithms for data mining tasks". A nice program that offers a UI which allows quick experimentation with a range of different algorithms.
