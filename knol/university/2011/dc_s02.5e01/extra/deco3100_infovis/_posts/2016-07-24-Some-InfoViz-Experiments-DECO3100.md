Sitting in to a few InfoViz classes in 2011 Semester 1, I tried out a few experiments with Processing.

In the first week, the class was given a refresher on Processing.

In the following weeks, we followed our own paths.

Discovering how to gather a series of images in the file directory, put them into a montage using their colour values to match a larger image. And making it interactive. [[Source Code]](_posts_assets/wk2b - src - INTERACTIVE COLLAGE - Eclipse,Java.zip)

In another excercise; created a quick system for manually untangling a directional graph (for hierarchical information visualisation purposes). [[Source Code]](_posts_assets/wk3T1b - src - NODE UNTANGLEMENT - Eclipse,Java.zip)
