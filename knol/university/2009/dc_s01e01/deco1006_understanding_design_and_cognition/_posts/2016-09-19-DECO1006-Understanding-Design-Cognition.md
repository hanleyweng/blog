Understanding Design and Cognition was one of the first core subjects of the Design Computing degree. This session was taught by Mike Rosenman.

The course content was incredibly interesting; covering the theoretical basics of Design and human cognition - aligning closely with Cognitive Science.

We also had amazing guest lectuerers: Kaz Grace on Artificial Intelligence in Design, Paul Murty on How Designers Think, and Andy Dong on Why we Design.
