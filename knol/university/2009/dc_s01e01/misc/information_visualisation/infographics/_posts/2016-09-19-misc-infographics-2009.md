I was recently introduced to the notion of infographics and have started playing with them:

An inforpgraphic of all possible Design Computing Subjects (as of 2006) and their recommended and suggested requirements.

## Birth Death rate (~per minute)

Every second, approximately 1.8 humans die, and 4.2 humans are born.

## Letter Frequency

The frequency of letters tapped on a keyboard.

## Hello

The sound for 'hello' in different languages. This was more to test if there were any shared characteristics which could be identified visually - though none appear evident.

## Procrastination vs Internet Speed
