# Cinema4D: Hello World Visual Experiments

Given a chance to play with Cinema4D, I played around a bit with the basics, focusing on lighting, and the notion of repetition, a cornerstone of procedural generation. 

All in all, C4D quite easily and quickly produces very nice renders (a much faster learning curve than that of Maya or Blender). This allows for rapid sketching and expression of visual ideas.
