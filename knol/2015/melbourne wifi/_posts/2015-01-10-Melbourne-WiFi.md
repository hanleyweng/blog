I've been exploring Melbourne CBD now for the past month. As a freelancer, I often need decent internet.

I thought I'd share my list of places with wifi and their speeds for the fellow travelling geek or freelancer. 

Generally there are 4 main places for WiFi:

- Hotels/Hostels/Motels. (Very Slow, Often Capped)
- Libraries. (Decent Speed, No Cap)
- Universities. (Fast, No Cap)
- Personal Hotspot. (Mobile, Fast, Capped)

Elaborating on these:

__Accomodations__ - can offer free and paid wifi, however all the ones i've seen are certainly not worth the price. You can't pay to get faster speeds, and paid plans often have both a data and time cap. You are much better off seeking free wifi at a nice cafe or one of Melbourne's awesome libraries or museums. 

- Tune Hotel Melbourne. (25ms ping, 1Mbps down, 1Mbps up)
- Oaks on Market. (25ms ping, 14Mbps down, 0.5Mbps up)
- Treasury on Collins. (Advertised as Highspeed internet. Hah! *cough*) (30ms ping, 1Mbps down, 0.1Mbps up)

__Libraries__ - all of Melbourne's libraries are quite nice and I would highly recommend visiting them.

- Library at the Dock. (30ms ping, 5Mbps down, 5Mbps up)
- Melbourne City Library. (20ms ping, 16Mbps down, 13Mbps up)
- State Victoria Library (not tested, but was also decent and felt similar to the other libraries: I'd estimate (~25ms ping, ~10Mbps down, ~10Mbps up))

__Universities__ - are especially great for WiFi especially if you have attended an Australian University / research company (this means you will have access too eduroam). Only University of Melbourne speeds were tested (took a good 15 minutes to connect, but blazingly fast speeds it when it did - note this was holiday period).

- University of Melbourne (23ms ping, 50MBps down, 115Mbps up)
- RMIT (not tested, also located in CBD, similar speeds assumed)

__Personal Hotspot__ - I also use my phone as a hotspot. With Telstra - this is limited bandwith of usually 1.5-7gb (depending on your plan), I've however found Telstra to be the most reliable of Australian telcos. 

- Telstra (40ms ping, 40Mbps down, 20MBps up)

_Note: I used ookla speed test for many of these readings. Most places were measured 2-3 times during a single time period within January 2015 (i.e. not multiple times in a day/week). Also everything in the CBD is within walking distance (there is also free transport)._

So, if you're a freelancing traveller, travelling freelancer, or a tourist with internet needs in Melbourne, the libraries and museums are great (soak in Melbourne whilst you're at it)! For even heavier use; Eduroam at Universities is awesome. As always, you should travel around with a hotspot if internet is high on your priorities.
