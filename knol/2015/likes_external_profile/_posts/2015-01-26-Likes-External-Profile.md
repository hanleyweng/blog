#### The Likes Project

_Identifying ones tastes can be dizzying in the mass media landscape of liked and favourited content. This project intends to shine a light onto how this personal data could be used to generate insights._

_This post is part of an ongoing series._

## External Profile

Recently, more sites and services have propped up that publicly profile users by their likes. 

The University of Cambridge's ['Apply Magic Sauce'](http://applymagicsauce.com/test.html) analyses ones Facebook Likes. From this it identified my education as being focused predominantly in Engineering and Psychology. Secondary to that was Art, IT & Business.

I actually thought Art would be more predominant from likes, but I suppose it makes sense in hindsight since most of the art I like is interactive and often grounded in engineering.

Google also tries to predict your interests through your use of their services. I was profiled like so:

The mention of Sports (Extreme, Skate, General) seemed odd to me as I'm not that into sports (though this probably has popped up due to me watching a few on youtube). 'Water & Marine Sciences' is also an odd addition - I can't imagine how Google profiled me with that interest.

_Also, weirdly enough. Even with all my information, Youtube can't seem to suggest videos I'd like to watch when I want to watch them. I have better luck signed out._

For future mining and historical record, I've also started to record my 'likes' more adamantly in one location. They are currently tweeted (either automatically when I like a youtube/vimeo video, or manually) at [@Hastebuds](https://twitter.com/hastebuds). Playing with CSS Columns, here's a moodboard-like capture of that feed:

_It should be noted though that my profiles are usually more accurate than others as I publicly like items with the intention of having them profiled and historically recorded._
