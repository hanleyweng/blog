0a. Nodes drawn in order of their distance from an edge event. Nodes that are part of a dissappearing / appearing edge are drawn first, followed by their adjacent nodes, and so on.

Series 62: Network renders of NCBI data as of November 2014. Size is mapped to Overall Degree of Nodes. Color is mapped to change in degree (red is negative, blue is postive). Degree changes greater than 1 are circled and labeled with degree change value.


0b. Nodes are all drawn simultaneously
