DVis Animation Interface Summary Guidelines

UI
	should have good affordances
	clean, with no visual clutter
	basic small multiple toggles
	basic theme/preset toggles
	timeline control

Animation
	Nodes
	emphasize nodes transitioning in/out
	nodes should have sufficient animation time in/out to stay in users' memories
	node animations should have the 'anticipation' principle leaving/arriving

	Edges
	emphasize edges transitioning in/out(~)
	emphasize edges changing weights
	edges can have a long-lasting trail
	edges can have a more emphasized signature at time of introduction
	edge tails can fade out over time (depends on context)

	Layout
	ability to select a global fixed layout or dynamic local layout

	Overall
	staged - remove, move, add
	option to change the staging - order and synchrony/asynchrony
	ability to render out the animation frame by frame in hq

	Independence
	independent of Visual Mapping & Graph Layout

Navigation
	Panning & Zooming
	should be allowed during animation
	ideally performed intuitively without buttons

	Timeline
	click anywhere to jump to that point in time
	for now - don't worry too much about what happens when some clicks a point in time, just pick something
	select a range rather than a specific time
	range selection can be detailed
	use natural language

	Play Button
	ideally speed is adjustable

	Independence
	independent of Theme & Graph Layout

Themes
	Dynamic Metrics
	ability to map to a live metric

	Visual Mapping
	some preset themes to start off with will do nicely
	later controls should be provided in order of information/control-hierarchy
	add polygonal-halo encoding as a possibility

	Animation Mapping
	various effects
	can tie in with visual mapping
	see 'Animation'

Additional Windows
	Key
	having a key provides a nice touch

	Small Multiples

	Live Aggregated Text
	use natural language

	Metadata
	must be integrated well, ideally with the timeline
	keypoints should be represented, especially with inconsistent timestamps
