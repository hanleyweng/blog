## Process

I've been seeing a lot of looping animated gifs lately and have been mesmerised by them so I had a quick go at creating my own. 

A [[processing sketch]](LoopedAnimationTrial/LoopedAnimationTrial.pde) was created which rendered images, images that were sequenced in Adobe Flash, and then rendered out as a gif.
