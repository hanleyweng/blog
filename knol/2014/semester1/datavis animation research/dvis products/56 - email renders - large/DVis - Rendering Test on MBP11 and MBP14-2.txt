DVis - Rendering Test on MBP11 and MBP14-2.txt

- simultaneous test started at 00:24
	- MBP11 running one
	- MBP14 running one

	- // note MBP11 is on 5% battery - charging - and hasn't increased in battery since start

	- MBP14 finished at 01:22

	- MBP14 - continued rendering after 01:22 completion
		- now started rendering 2 more simultaneously on MBP14
		- managed to finish one by 2:02, other one nearly done
		- other one finished at 2:09

		- Starting 2 more simultaneously at 2:09
		- one finished at 2:47
		- //other one left on as I went to bed

	- MBP11 one finally finished at 2:53
		- finally finished at 2:53
			- wow, that took 2.5 hours!
				^ - compared to other mbp which took 1hr
				 - followed by 2 simultaneously in 40-50mins

	- i.e. MBP14 definitely superior - and quite significantly as well for this particular task. Therefore it'll be good to upgrade or have a dedicated rendering machine around! (potentially one with more gb of ram than 16gb).
