               at the spaceship. It dodges a few but one hits it and it explodes. 
               The gorilla thumps its chest and "Game Over" flashes on the screen.

               was playing an arcade game called "Monkey Fracas Jr". He is in

               distinct forks at the front. There is a little kid standing next 
               to him. The game is against the wall in a pizzeria called Panucci's

                         the spray-on toupee and - of course 
                         - the technology to keep human heads 
                         alive in jars.  But wait, there's more. 
                         We've got a whole line-up of inventors 
                         tonight, starting with that up and coming

</b>                          New York City: the year 2000. The most 
                         wasteful society in the history of the 
                         galaxy and it was running out of places 
                         to empty its never-ending output of 
                         garbage.  The landfills were full. New 
                         Jersey was full. And so, under cover 
                         of darkness, the city put its garbage 
                         out to sea on the world's largest barge. 
                          The repulsive barge circled the oceans 
                         for 50 years but no country would accept 
                         it. Not even that really filthy one. 
                         You know the one I mean. Finally, in 
                         2052, the city used its mob connections 
                         to obtain a rocket and launch the garbage 
                         into outer space. Some experts claim 
                         the ball might return to Earth someday, 
                         but their concerns were dismissed as 
                         "depressing".
