I recently got the chance to play with and visualise some brain coactivation network data.

This was for the paper: [Resilience of human brain functional coactivation networks under thresholding](http://arxiv.org/abs/1407.1549) by S. Sarkar, S. Chawla, H. Weng

There were many cool looking visualisations formed from the mapping of certain network metrics to the network of coactivating nodes representing the brain.

During the early process of visualising this network, I applied a simple spring-layout algorithm to the network ('Force Atlas'), interestingly enough, the network began to resemble the side view of the cerebelum! Suggesting the topological aspects of the network reflect their physical structure!
