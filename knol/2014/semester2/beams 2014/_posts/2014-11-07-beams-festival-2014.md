## Process

I personally enjoyed the iterative process taken during this project very much. We had very little time to work on this, but since we started out with a concept that was simple to implement with large potential for growth and had a very flexible visual aesthetic - we could continuously develop the concept, experimenting with new techniques and visuals that were inspired by each agile iteration without being tied down with any initial high fidelity assets.

Here are some [video snapshots](youtube playlist) of the process: 

An early implementation of background subtraction, this turned out to be unnecessarily heavy for our use-case, so in the end we simply replaced this with a depth threshold.

A depth-based vertical slit scan.

And with color!
