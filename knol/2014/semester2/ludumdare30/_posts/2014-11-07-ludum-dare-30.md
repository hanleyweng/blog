## Procedural Runner

This game is one-button runner where you must run faster and faster to jump between different dimensions to deliver vital messages.

## Process

It was kind of nice playing with a 3D environment and lighting. I also quite like the polygonal 3D aesthetic.

Lessons / observations:

- 3D + Procedural in 48 hours wasn’t a good idea – I underestimated how much time this would take.
- Remedies: Either go 2D, or switch to the Ludum Dare Jam for 3D works (so existing assets or collaboration is available).
