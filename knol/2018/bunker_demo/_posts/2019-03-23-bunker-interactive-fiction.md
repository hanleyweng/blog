In the realm of Conversational AI, there's a lot of room to create dialogue-orientated stories that we can interact with.

The NLP is built on top of the Inform 7 system. For back and forth conversation, local Speech to Text transcription was attempted. However, the accuracy of the results were too low so alternative services like Google Cloud's Enterprise Speech to Text will be required for better experiences.

Interactive Fiction is ripe for a revival in the modern age of ML-facilitated voice experiences.
